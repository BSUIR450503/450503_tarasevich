* [Lab 1](#lab1 "Move to Lab 1!")
* [Lab 2](#lab2 "Move to Lab 2!")
* [Lab 3](#lab3 "Move to Lab 3!")
* [Lab 4](#lab4 "Move to Lab 4!")
* [Lab 5](#lab5 "Move to Lab 5!")
* [Lab 6](#lab6 "Move to Lab 6!")

#### <a name="lab1">Lab 1</a>

* on Win 
  - Compile executable file of `Proc_child.cpp` with lib.
  - Then move `<your_exe_name>.exe` to the directory of your parent's compiled exe.
  - Profit.

* on Linux 
  - Just compile all the .cpps in the same directory and run parent.
  
#### <a name="lab2">Lab 2</a>

* on Win
  - If there are secure warnings, turn them off (on Visual C++).

* on Linux
  - Install ncurses.
  - Compile with g++ (example: `g++ -o execute main.cpp -lcurses`).
  - Run `execute` file (or your `<filename>`).

#### <a name="lab3">Lab 3</a>

* on Win
  - If there are secure warnings, turn them off (on Visual C++).

* on Linux
  - Compile with g++ (example: `g++ -o execute main.cpp loop.cpp`).
  - Run `execute` file (or your `<filename>`).

#### <a name="lab4">Lab 4</a>
* on Win
  - If there are secure warnings, turn them off (on Visual C++).

* on Linux
  - Install ncurses.
  - Compile with g++ (example: `g++ -o execute main.cpp Thread.cpp -lpthread -lcurses`).
  - Run `execute` file (or your `<filename>`).

#### <a name="lab5">Lab 5</a>
* on Win
  - Install MinGW/MSYS with gcc & make.
  - Run msys.bat.
  - Type `make` into bash.
  - Run `lab5` file.

* on Linux
  - Type `make` into bash.
  - Run `lab5` file.

#### <a name="lab6">Lab 6</a>
* only Linux available
  - Compile with g++ (example: `g++ -o <filename> main.cpp`). `<filename>` is your custom file name.
