That .txt is a kind of a guide "How to Run This Lab".
p.s. I think there is no need to write or to read this, but...

-- on Win
1. Compile executable file of "Proc_child.cpp" with lib;
2. Then move <your_exe_name>.exe to the directory of your parent's compiled exe;
3. Profit.

-- on Linux
1. Just compile all the .cpps in the same directory and run parent.

Thx for reading!
